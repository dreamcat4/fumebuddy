# fumebuddy
Fumebuddy is an ESP32 powered replacement for the Hakko FX-951's on-hook switch. I've posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx5LyRIb3mM">a video</a> briefly going over the idea behind it.

The default behaviour is to control an <a href="https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna">espurna</a> powered smart-switch. However, since it is open source, fumebuddy can be made to do almost anything you'd like.

<a href="https://github.com/Hieromon/AutoConnect">AutoConnect</a> is used to handle configuring WiFi as well as various options after the intial setup is completed.
